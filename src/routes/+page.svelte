<p>The purpose of this group is to organize X-Wing Miniatures players in the Phoenix area so we can share tips, ideas, and when and where games are happening locally with one another. We're committed to growing a fun and helpful community of players, while being respectful of other community members. Keep discussions civil and constructive. There will be zero tolerance for any form of bullying or personal attacks - disagreement is fine, disrespect is not. Please do your best to keep the group's tone light-hearted, inclusive, and constructive. Thanks, and welcome!</p>
